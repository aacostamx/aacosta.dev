          <hr>
          <p>I am a Software Engineer graduated from Tec de Culiacan in 2011.</p>
          <p>In 2010. I started working with Homex, a house constructor company, where I started programming an existing web application to manage and control business flows. I learned .Net, and ASP.NET</p>
          <p>Then I moved to Nubeware because in my mind I was thinking that I should be in a completely technical company, in order to gain experience. There I worked along with US clients, and I started to have interactions in another language.</p>
          <p>I stayed in Nubeware for around 3 years working with the same technology .NET. In that company, I gain more experience as a .NET developer and have a good relationship with technical customers.</p>
          <p>After then, I joined Neoris, well-formed tech company, they have offices around the world and big clients. Here, I worked directly with technical and non-technical customers. I did analysis & design, then the implementation of the requirements of many projects.</p>
          <!-- <p>In 2015, I joined Wizeline in Guadalajara, At that moment the company had around 100 employees. Nowadays more than 500. It is a good challenge to be in a company that grows so fast, at the same time very exciting. I started as a Software Engineer, doing many projects in Javascript, Nodejs, python. Also, I work along with some Data Science colleagues. Now, I got promoted to Sr Software Engineer due to my skills and abilities to improve customer relationships. I focused in to create a healthy team environment, so together we can get achieve any goal and succeed expectations.</p> -->
